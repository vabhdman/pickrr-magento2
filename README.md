###Usage Instructions (only for manual calls, when automatic shipment mode is not enabled):

####Import helper class:

```php
//import helper class

Pickrr\Magento2\Helper\ExportShipment $helper;

```

####Create a simple Pickrr Shipment:

Passing $pickup_time and $cod is optional.

**Prototype of the function:**
```php
createShipment($auth_token, $item_name, $from_name, $from_phone_number, $from_pincode, $from_address, $to_name, $to_phone_number, $to_pincode, $to_address, $invoice_amount, $cod=0.0, $pickup_time = 'NULL', $order_id = 'NULL')
```

It returns the tracking_id from Pickrr.

**Usage:**
```php
//Create shipment using order

$auth_key =  'Your Auth Key';

$helper->createOrderShipment($auth_key, "Item's Name", "Merchant/Sender's Name", "Merchant/Sender's Phone", 'Pickup Address Pin', 'Pickup Address', 300.0, 300.0, '2016-06-17 17:00');
```

####Create Shipment using order:

This will also create shipment and associate it with the passed order. The client/customer's address, item's name and order's id will be extracted from order.

**Prototype of the function:**
```php
createOrderShipment($auth_token, $order, $from_name, $from_phone_number, $from_pincode, $from_address, $invoice_amount, $cod=0.0, $pickup_time = 'NULL');

```

**Usage:**
```php
//Create shipment using order

$auth_key =  'Your Auth Key';
$order = $objectManager->get('Magento\Sales\Model\Order')->loadByIncrementId('100000094');

$helper->createOrderShipment($auth_key, $order, "Merchant/Sender's Name", "Merchant/Sender's Phone", 'Pickup Address Pin', 'Pickup Address' , 300.0, 300.0, '2016-06-17 17:00');
```
